## 📝 How to Set Up Your Roadmap in Apple Notes

Follow these quick steps to turn the plain text checklists into a functional, interactive tracker on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

### **Step 1: Copy the Text**
Open one of the subject files linked above (e.g., *Mathematical Foundations*) and **copy** the entire block of text.

### **Step 2: Paste into Apple Notes**
Open the **Apple Notes** app, create a new note (e.g., titled "Sem 1 AI/ML Tracker"), and **paste** the text.

### **Step 3: Create the Checkboxes**
1.  **Select (Highlight)** all the text you just pasted (exclude the main Note Title).
2.  Tap the **Checklist Icon** (the checkmark inside a circle) in the toolbar.
    * *Note:* This will turn every single line into a checkbox.

### **Step 4: Format the Milestones (Headers)**
Now, you will separate the "Headers" from the "To-Do" items:

1.  Place your cursor on a **Milestone** line (e.g., *Milestone 1: Linear Algebra...*).
2.  Tap the **Aa** formatting button (or "BIU" menu on mobile) and select **Subheading** (or Bold).
    * *This makes the text big and bold and removes the checkbox from header, acting as a clear divider.*
3. Repeat Step 1 & 2 for each "Milestone" line.
