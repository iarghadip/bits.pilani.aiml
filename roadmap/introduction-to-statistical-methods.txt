Introduction to Statistical Methods

Milestone 1: Probability Fundamentals

Sample Spaces & Events: Defining sample spaces, outcomes, events, and set operations such as union and intersection.
Axioms of Probability: The three foundational axioms of probability and their important corollaries.
Conditional Probability: Computing probabilities given partial or prior information.
Independence: Mathematical definition of independent events and comparison with mutually exclusive events.
Bayes’ Theorem: Updating probabilities based on new evidence, forming the foundation of Naive Bayes classifiers.
Total Probability Law: Decomposing complex probabilities into sums of conditional probabilities.

Milestone 2: Random Variables & Expectations

Discrete Random Variables: Probability Mass Functions (PMF) and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF).
Continuous Random Variables: Probability Density Functions (PDF) and computing probabilities using integration.
Expectation (Mean): Calculating expected values for discrete and continuous random variables.
Variance & Standard Deviation: Measuring dispersion and variability in random variables.
Moments: Higher-order moments including skewness and kurtosis to describe distribution shape.
Moment Generating Functions (MGF): Using MGFs to derive moments and identify probability distributions.

Milestone 3: Common Probability Distributions

Bernoulli & Binomial Distributions: Modeling binary outcomes and counts of successes in repeated trials.
Poisson Distribution: Modeling the rate of occurrence of events over time or space.
Uniform Distribution: Discrete and continuous uniform distributions with equal probability outcomes.
Normal (Gaussian) Distribution: The bell curve, standard normal distribution (Z-scores), and the empirical rule.

Exponential Distribution: Modeling the time until an event occurs and the memoryless property.
Gamma & Beta Distributions: Flexible continuous distributions commonly used as conjugate priors in Bayesian analysis.

Milestone 4: Joint Distributions & Sampling

Joint PDFs and PMFs: Modeling probabilities involving two or more random variables.
Marginal & Conditional Distributions: Deriving single-variable distributions from joint distributions.
Covariance & Correlation: Measuring the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables.
Independence of Random Variables: Conditions and methods for checking whether random variables are independent.
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT): Explaining why sample means tend toward a normal distribution.
Sampling Distributions: Distributions of sample statistics such as the sample mean and sample variance (Chi-square distribution).

Milestone 5: Estimation Theory

Point Estimation: Estimating population parameters using sample data.
Properties of Estimators: Bias, consistency, efficiency, and mean squared error (MSE).
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): Deriving parameter estimates that maximize the likelihood function.
Confidence Intervals: Constructing confidence intervals for means (known and unknown variance) and proportions.
Prediction Intervals: Estimating a plausible range for a future individual observation.

Milestone 6: Hypothesis Testing

Testing Basics: Formulating null and alternative hypotheses.
Errors in Testing: Type I errors (false positives) and Type II errors (false negatives).
Power of a Test: Probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis.
Parametric Tests: Z-tests and t-tests including one-sample, two-sample, and paired tests.
P-Value Approach: Interpreting p-values for statistical decision making.
Chi-Square Tests: Goodness-of-fit and independence tests for categorical data.
